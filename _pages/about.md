Hi! My name is **Justin Ellery**, I'm an IT professional working in the Public Safety sector, based in Ontario, Canada.


I love to play sports, including hockey, golf and cycling. I enjoy staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, I would love to motivate or encourage that for even just one person out there! 


My hope for this website is to share my experiences and insights with others, while continuing to learn and grow every single day myself.


I enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals - please feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ellery_Justin), or give me a follow on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23713377) to see what I've been up to!
